# E-language-translator

## About
A small python script that translates text to the "E language", a language my friend made up (essentially just all vowels replaced with a capital 'E').

The language was inspired by the Lord Marquaad E meme.

## Execute
Make sure Python 3 is installed. Clone this repository. In a terminal, navigate to the directory containing main.py and run `python main.py` to execute.
